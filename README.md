# C-Sharp-Project

This is a C# project I made in COMP 2614.

This project was created in Visual Studio 2019.

This was one of my vary first ever GUI projects, and features key bindings, and custom icons.

Originally in the class we had access to a database to fill our main panel GUI; but the class ended awhile ago, and the database was subsequently closed permantely.

You will however be able to examine the code, and GUI design in the sln file :)
